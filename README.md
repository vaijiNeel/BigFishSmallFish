# BigFishSmallFish

This app was created using HTML5, Bootstrap, JQuery, FireBase db, googlemap api, openWeather api. The entire screen is covered with world map on the background and some random small fish (generated at set time interval by the app) pops up on the screen. User can create their own fish and can devour other fish that has less level, and can keep growing bigger. The weather api displays live weather report for the place where the User fish is on the world map.
